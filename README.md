This repo is where I keep a list of my tech talks about application security, women in tech and related topics.

My name is Julia. I'm from Ukraine üá∫üá¶ Nice to meet you! üëã 

I'm a Lead Security Engineer at [Cossack Labs](https://cossacklabs.com), building convenient and affordable data security and encryption solutions. My main personal specialization is mobile application security and Secure SDLC, as I have a solid background in mobile application development. Together with my team I like to build secure stuff, not to break it üòÑ I hold an SSCP certification.

Take a look at case studies for projects I worked on: 

‚≠ê [Product security for one of the biggest African banks](https://www.cossacklabs.com/case-studies/african-bank/)

‚≠ê [Xumm wallet security assurance and improvements](https://www.cossacklabs.com/case-studies/xumm-xrp-wallet-security/)

‚≠ê [Building ironclad data security for M&A solution leader](https://www.cossacklabs.com/case-studies/vdr/)

‚≠ê [Cryptographic IP protection for AI/ML product](https://www.cossacklabs.com/case-studies/aiml/)

‚≠ê [Crypto wallet security assessment for Temple Wallet](https://www.cossacklabs.com/case-studies/temple-wallet/)

I'm passionate about local tech communities. üë©üèº‚Äçüíª I'm a Director at [Women Who Code Kyiv](https://www.womenwhocode.com/kyiv), a Leader of the [OWASP Zhytomyr Chapter](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-zhytomyr), and a contributor to [OWASP MAS](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg).

# Crypto Wallets Security. For developers

The main ideas I've covered in my talk are:
- Crypto wallets security is not only about the blockchain, it is also about regular application security;
- Bypassing application-level security controls can be much easier than breaking cryptography;
- Application developers are not experts in cryptography, they usuallyy need assistance;
- Web3 enthusiast may not have deep knowlendge of security controls of the platform they are working on, e.g. web or mobile.
