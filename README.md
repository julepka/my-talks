This repo is where I keep a list of my tech talks about application security and related topics.

My name is Julia. Nice to meet you! üëã I'm a Security Software Engineer at [Cossack Labs](https://cossacklabs.com), building convenient and affordable data security and encryption solutions. My main personal specialization is mobile application security, as I have a solid background in mobile application development. I like to build stuff, not to break it üòÑ

Take a look at our open-source tools: 

‚≠ê [Themis](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis) - high-level cryptographic library, suppotring 14 platforms/languages.

‚≠ê [Acra](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra) - database security suite field level encryption for sensitive data protection.

Also, I'm passionate about local tech communities. üë©üèº‚Äçüíª I'm a Security Lead at [Women Who Code Kyiv](https://www.womenwhocode.com/kyiv), a Leader of the [OWASP Zhytomyr Chapter](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-zhytomyr), and a contributor to [OWASP MASVS/MSTG](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg).
